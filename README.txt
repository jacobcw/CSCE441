** NOT COMPILED AS A .EXE **
- I own a Macbook and couldn't get it to compile into a working .exe file
- I also couldnt use computer's on campus because it required moving files into admin directories
- Willing to come into office hours to try and figure something out
- Included makefile for ease of compilation
	- type ‘make’
	- run with ‘./A1’
